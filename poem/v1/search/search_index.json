The page is shown in the image below. Metric templates may be filtered by name, probe, and tag (active or passive). By clicking on the metric template name, user can access particular metric template page. It is also possible to access particular probe version by clicking on its name. Metric template details Depending on metric template type, pages for particular metric templates are a bit different. Active metric template must have a probe assigned to it, while passive metric template does not. Active metric templates Active metric template's page is shown in the image below. Field descriptions Mandatory fields in case of active metric template: Name - metric template name; Probe - probe name and version. This field is autocomplete, user must choose from available probes; Type - type (active or passive; active in this example); Probe executable - executable file; Config maxCheckAttempts - used to define the number of times that Nagios will retry the service check command if it returns any state other than an OK state; setting this value to 1 will cause Nagios to generate an alert without retrying the service check again; timeout - timeout (in seconds) for probe, path - path to executable file, interval - used to define the time (in minutes) to wait before scheduling the next \"regular\" check of the service; \"regular\" checks are those that occur when the service is in an OK state or when the service is in a non-OK state, but has already been rechecked maxCheckAttempts number of times; retryInterval - used to define the time (in minutes) to wait before scheduling a re-check of the service; services are rescheduled at the retry interval when they have changed to a non-OK state; once the service has been retried maxCheckAttempts times without a change in its status, it will revert to being scheduled at its \"normal\" rate as defined by the interval value. Attributes Attributes are part of metric template definition. They are used to pass values as arguments to metric command (e.g. TCP port on which service is listening, SE path, CE queue...). Description of attributes is given in the table below. Attribute Description BDII_PORT BDII port. BDII_DN BDII base DN BDII_TYPE Type of BDII, can be one of the following: bdii_top and bdii_site . CREAM_PORT CREAM CE port. CREAM_QUEUE CREAM CE queue for a given VO. FTS_PORT FTS port. GRIDFTP_PORT GridFTP port. GRAM_PORT GRAM Gatekeeper port. HOST_NAME Hostname of the monitored box. Do not use this attribute for parameter -H because it is set automatically. KEYSTORE Location of Java keystore with host certificate. Default value is /etc/nagios/globus/keystore.jks . LL_PORT LocalLogger port. MYPROXY_PORT MYPROXY port. NAGIOS_HOST_CERT Location of host certificate with nagios user ownership. Value is /etc/nagios/globus/hostcert.pem . NAGIOS_HOST_KEY Location of host certificate key with nagios user ownership. Value is /etc/nagios/globus/hostkey.pem . PATH Path extracted from URL. PORT Port extracted from URL. RGMA_PORT RGMA port. SE_PATH Storage element path for a given VO. serviceType _URL URL extracted topology database (e.g. GOCDB attribute URL); serviceType prefix is used in order to avoid collision in case of multiple serviceTypes on a same host. SITE_BDII Hostname of Site BDII. SITENAME Site name. SRM1_PORT SRM1 port. SRM2_PORT SRM2.2 port. SSL Attribute is set if URL scheme is https:// . TOMCAT_PORT TOMCAT port.

URL URL extracted topology database (e.g. GOCDB attribute URL). VOBOX_PORT VOBOX port. WMPROXY_PORT WMPROXY port. Flags Flags are part of metric definition and control how the NCG configures metric. Below is description currently supported flags. Flag Description NOARGS Metric's command is configured without arguments. NOHOSTNAME Metric's command is configured without -H parameter. NRPE_SERVICE Metric is configured to be executed via NRPE on service node. NOPUBLISH Metric results are not published to AMS. PASSIVE If defined, metric is part of a complex check. NCG configures metric as passive check only. Results for the metric should be generated by parent metric or received via message bus. VO Metric is VO dependent. Metric is configured multiple time for each VO or VO FQAN defined. In case that VO is not supported on a given host, metric is not generated at all. Passive metric templates Page for particular passive metric template is considerably reduced and it is shown in the image below. Mandatory fields in case of passive metric template: Name - metric template name; Type - type (active or passive; passive in this example); Flags PASSIVE flag is mandatory for passive metrics - it is added automatically when passive type is chosen through the UI and it is disabled to prevent users from accidentally deleting it.
